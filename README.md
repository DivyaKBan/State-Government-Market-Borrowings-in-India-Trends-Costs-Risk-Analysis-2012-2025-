# 📊 State Government Market Borrowings Analysis (India)

## 🧩 Project Overview
This project presents an end-to-end **data analytics and Power BI dashboard solution**
to analyze **State Government Market Borrowings (State Development Loans – SDLs)** in India.
Using publicly available RBI data, the project explores borrowing trends, cost of funds,
maturity behavior, and state-wise risk patterns to derive **policy-relevant and
investment-focused insights**.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem / Objective
State governments raise funds through market borrowings, but:
- Borrowing costs vary significantly across states
- Maturity structures have changed over time
- Risk concentration is uneven across regions

### Objectives:
- Analyze **borrowing volume trends** over time
- Compare **state-wise borrowing behavior**
- Assess **cost of borrowing using yield analysis**
- Study **maturity trends and fiscal risk indicators**
- Build an **executive-ready Power BI dashboard**

---

## 📂 Dataset Description
- **Source**: Reserve Bank of India (RBI) – State Government Market Borrowings (SDL Auctions)
- **Format**: Excel / CSV
- **Time Period**: 2012 – 2025
- **Granularity**: State-level, year-wise aggregated data

Each row represents aggregated borrowing metrics for a specific state in a given year.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Python**: Pandas, NumPy
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Data preprocessing & analysis
- **Power BI**: Interactive dashboards
- **Excel**: Initial data inspection

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard Overview

### 1️⃣ Executive Overview
**Purpose**: High-level summary for policymakers and analysts

---

### 2️⃣ Cost & Risk Analysis
**Purpose**: Identify high-cost and high-risk borrowing patterns

**Insights Enabled:**
- States borrowing more at higher yields
- Increasing maturity indicating long-term debt exposure

---

### 3️⃣ State-wise Borrowing Distribution & Comparison
**Purpose**: Regional and competitive analysis

## 📌 Key Insights & Findings
- A small group of states accounts for the majority of total borrowings
- Borrowing volumes increased sharply post-2019
- Average yields declined initially but show volatility in recent years
- Longer maturity bonds are increasingly preferred
- Some low-borrowing states still face relatively high borrowing costs

---

## 💼 Business Impact & Use Cases
- **Policy Makers**: Monitor fiscal risk and debt sustainability
- **Investors**: Compare SDL risk-return profiles
- **Financial Analysts**: Identify cost-heavy borrowing states
- **Banks & Institutions**: Track government borrowing behavior

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Secondary market performance not included
- Inflation and GSDP data not integrated
- Demand-side bid depth is limited

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Integrate inflation, GSDP, and fiscal deficit indicators
- Yield forecasting using regression or ML models
- Auction demand–supply analysis
- State-wise fiscal risk scoring framework
